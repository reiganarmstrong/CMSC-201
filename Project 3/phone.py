"""
    Phone Class Starter Code

    This code defines the basic functionality that you need from a phone.
    When these functions are called they should communicate with the
    switchboards to find a path

        This function should return the connection status to disconnected.  You need
        to use new members of this class to determine how the phone is connected to
        the other phone.

        You should also make sure to disconnect the other phone on the other end of the line.
